# CRYPTOGRAPH-STUDY-AND-ITS-APPLICATION

Cryptography deals with the actual securing of digital data. It refers to the design of mechanisms based on mathematical algorithms that provide fundamental information security services.Privacy or secrecy is the fundamental security service provided by cryptography. The goal of this project is to make a system which encodes a given set of data (so as to protect it from the outside world) by using a key and send it to the receiver ,who can decode the received data using the same or different key. Even if someone in the middle wants to sneak the data that was sent, he will not succeed as the keys are unknown to him. Here in this project we have laid down a brief description of the task that we did this semester. Firstly we described what cryptography is and the various algorithms needed to implement cryptography. In the later part of this report we described about symmetric and asymmetric cryptosystem. Finally we developed a new algorithm which we named as SSA (Semi Symmetric Asymmetric ) algorithm. As the name suggests it is a combination of both symmetric and asymmetric components. Finally we described how the SSA algorithm works and how it was implemented in our project.
